# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
This is my second Machine Learning Project where I have tried to predict whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant. I have used both Logistic Regression and SVM on the data and got almost similar accuracy in both cases. I have used my knowledge of Normalization and using the optimum values of C and Gamma as well.
